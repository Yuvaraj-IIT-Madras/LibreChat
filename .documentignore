# Auto-generated .documentignore file
# Generated by tech_analyzer.py using LLM analysis
# Customize as needed for your specific project

# Analysis: This is a comprehensive list of patterns that should be ignored. These include artifacts generated when the project is built, dependency caches, IDE artifacts, and other things that are not useful to include in a repository. Framework specific directories target files and folders that automatically generated during production runtime like cache, logs, and session files.
